# Map Stats
- Map 1:
	- Length: 6080 units
	- Difficulty: Easy
	- Basic walls
	- Death walls
	- All mechanics of basic movement

# Map ideas (numbers are the ideas that they were originally thought of, the order is the order in which we make them)
- Map 1: Basic Map
	- Name: Base Camp
	- is literally the base map, nothing is special or changes
- Map 2: Dashing
	- Removes sliding and double jump from player movement
	- Player has an in air dash
	- Player can stick to more surfaces
	- If player stands on tiles for too long, it disappears (not the floor tho)
- Map 4: Ice
	- Player once starts moving, they cannot stop (properties of ice surface) until they run out of momentum I guess
	- sliding gains lots of speed
- Map 5: Weird jumping
	- player replaces jumping and double jumping with boosters that only fire in quick boosts
	- can change directions in air unlike regular jumping
	- is the same keybind as jumping, but it is less powerful
	- it can be re-cast as many times as it has charge
	- recharges when standing on a flat surface, not when sticking to a wall or something
- Map 11: Glitched
	- Free content for Youtubers
	- Free map that has the pay to play logo on it, but when you click on it, you can play it
	- Starts off as if it were a map that was being designed and not done yet, but as you get further up, it becomes clear that this was intentional? (story line behind map)
	- Special thing is the constantly changing graphics, and that your player will rift or teleport uncontrollably, but in a way that is helpful
		- 90 percent of the time at the lower stages of the map
		- 75 percent of the time at the later stages of the map
- Map 6: Leap of Faith
	- there are like, 3 paths up that all get to the same spot and all are equally difficult
	- only one of the paths is able to make it to the end. (randomly decided before)
		- however to say that it is not an rng map, there will be one slight difference in the art down near the bottom before the map splits into three parts.
			- Like, one very small thing
		- At the end of each path, there will be a wall there, however, on two of them, it will just be the artwork and an actual wall
	- There will be a path up to the start of each path.
	 	- makes it harder when after realizing on path is not real, that u have to change paths and risk falling more
	<!-- (Previos 3 path idea. scraped for now)- the paths all start at different places
		- have to get up some of each path to get to the start point of the next path
		- but it is basically a checkpoint
	- The first path goes straight up to the thing
	- the second path goes up the first path for a bit, then goes a bit higher then the end point and has to go horizontally back towards the first path, falling would mean that you are put back onto the first path -->
- Map 7:
	- Camera doesn't follow player, it is based on screens
	- When player goes into other screen, it changes to the other screen
- Map 8:
	- Cannot stop jumping (just trying to be really annoying)
- Map 9: Volcano
	- Lava timed to flow from a certain place
		- if lava is flowing down, you have to time it so u dont hit lava.
- Map 10: Underwater
	- Sharks going back and forth that you have to dodge
	- jump on moving fish
	- all in loop
- Map 3: Horizontal
	- Player has all basic movement, but map is horizontal
	- Special thing like the map is trying to pull the player towards the starting point (idk)
