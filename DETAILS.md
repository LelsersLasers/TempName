# Map ideas
- Map 1: Basic Map
	- is literally the base map, nothing is special or changes
- Map 2: Dashing
	- Removes sliding and double jump from player movement
	- Player has an in air dash
	- Player can stick to more surfaces
- Map 3: Horizontal
	- Player has all basic movement, but map is horizontal
	- Special thing like the map is trying to pull the player towards the starting point (idk)
- Map 4: Ice
	- Player once starts moving, they cannot stop (properties of ice surface) until they run out of momentum I guess
	- sliding gains lots of speed
- Map 5: Weird jumping
	- player replaces jumping and double jumping with boosters that only fire in quick boosts
	- can change directions in air unlike regular jumping
	- is the same keybind as jumping, but it is less powerful
	- it can be re-cast as many times as it has charge
	- recharges when standing on a flat surface, not when sticking to a wall or something
- Map 6:
	- there are like, 3 paths up that all get to the same spot and all are equally difficult
	- the paths all start at different places
		- have to get up some of each path to get to the start point of the next path
		- but it is basically a checkpoint
	- The first path goes straight up to the thing
	- the second path goes up the first path for a bit, then goes a bit higher then the end point and has to go horizontally back towards the first path, falling would mean that you are put back onto the first path
