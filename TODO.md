Everything

Bugs:
- main.py - set_delta():
    - last_loop_time is sometimes 0
    - How to increase timing precision
    - Temp solution: if last_loop_time == 0, last_delta = 1


- 'clean' main() by breaking into functions
    - Ex: master_draw(), set_Delta()/set_FPS(), etc

- good full screen
    - hold a 16:9 ratio
    - scale things based on screen size

- 'screen' = "welcome", "directions", "save", etc

- use magic/duner for Vector class?
