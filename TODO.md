# Basically Everything

# Bugs
SOLVED?: main.py - set_delta()
- sometimes the value is much too high

# Cleaning
Some random lines in main.create_window()
- What do they do?

# Bottom Up

- 'screen' = "welcome", "directions", "save", etc

- use magic/duner for Vector class?

# Notes
Keys:
- WASD to move green hb
- Control + Q to quit
