# Basically Everything

# Bugs
SOLVED?: main.py - set_delta()

# Cleaning


# Bottom Up
Rooms


# To test:
All of the AdvancedHitbox/HitboxPart code
- updating functions
- check_collisions/etc
- is it 'easy' to use?
    - Or will it cause writing Enemy/Player classes to be unessicarly complicated

# Notes
Keys:
- WASD: move player (green)
- Control + Q: quit
- Enter/lmb: change screen from welcome to game
