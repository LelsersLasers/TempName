# TODO
Everything

Bugs:
- SOLVES?: main.py - set_delta()
    - sometimes the value is much too high
- main.py - handle_keys()
    - the vector is not corrently applied
    - issue possibly in classes.py - Vector.apply()

- 'clean' main() by breaking into functions
    - Ex: master_draw(), set_Delta()/set_FPS(), etc

- good full screen
    - hold a 16:9 ratio
    - scale things based on screen size

- 'screen' = "welcome", "directions", "save", etc

- use magic/duner for Vector class?
